# LMS DOWNLOAD ATTEMPTS

## Info

Lms is the school system we use on my study.
We can request different things with `lms` but not all the made attempts.

## Why?

I made it because when my laptop broke I went to backup laptop and wanted all my assignments back.
I didn't want to write `lms download <attemptname>` every time so I created this.
The first attempt of creating this was very big and clumsy. It worked but didn't feel right.
Now I am on my new laptop and thought it can be better.
So I created this and feels more clear and correct.
